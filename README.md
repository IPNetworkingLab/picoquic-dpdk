# picoquic-dpdk

This is a version of [PICOQUIC](https://github.com/private-octopus/picoquic) with support for [DPDK](https://www.dpdk.org/), which provides better performance by bypassing the kernel networking stack. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

This project was done by Nikita Tyunyayev for the master thesis titled "Improving the performance of PICOQUIC by using kernel bypass techniques with the DPDK library".
